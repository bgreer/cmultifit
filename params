# first line is main spectrum to read
../hmi/new_su_rsb.avgpspec_fd15.2099.+00.0.+00.0.mean.fits
#../simring/4deg/spec_180.00_+00.00_pr.fits
#../tests/hmi_2.5deg_9hr/new_2.5deg.fits

# second line is model file
hmi_trunc.model

# third line is the file to output to
out

# fourth is silent mode (1 = silent)
0

# fifth is chi squared weighting
# 0 = normal (weighted by noise, see below)
# 1 = maximum likelihood (weighted by fit value)
#     no noise is computed, so next parameter is irrelevant.
#	  Note: mpfit is not optimized for this, so it takes more iterations
#	   you might want to increase the max # of iterations
1

# sixth is noise estimator
# 0 = constant, set as 0.1*(global average power)
# 1 = smoothed, set as 0.1*(local average power)
# 2 = wavelet, uses WT to estimate noise using smallest scale fluctuations
0

# seventh is k-range for fitting, space separated
# values outside range of spectrum are cropped to ends
0 999

# Next are parameters for fit convergence

# Relative chi-square convergence criterium
1e-8

# Relative parameter convergence criterium
1e-4

# Orthogonality convergence criterium
1e-8

# Max number of iterations.
# If this number is hit before convergence, fit is deemed invalid
800


# Next are filenames for debug output. Fair warning, they produce a lot of data

# Fit output. Set to 0 for no output
# After each successful multifit, outputs fit result
# Format (8 columns):
# theta	k	nu	data	fit	noise	background	residual
debug

# Covariance output. Set to 0 for no output
# After each successful multifit, outputs log10 of covariance matrix
# If set to 'file', output files will be 'file_##', where ## is the k-bin
# Format (3 columns):
# i	j	log10(abs(cov(i,j)))
covar

# To easily plot, use gnuplot:
# set pm3d map
# splot 'covar'

# Background output. Set to 0 for no output
# After each successful multifit, outputs final parameters of background terms
# Format (8 columns):
# k-bin	k	par0	par1	par2	par3	par4	par5
backcoefs

# Perform fits
# Useful for testing the model file
