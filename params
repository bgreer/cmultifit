# first line is main spectrum to read
../hmi/new_su_rsb.avgpspec_fd15.2099.+37.5.+70.0.mean.fits

# second line is model file

# third line is the file to output to
out

# fourth is silent mode (1 = silent)
0

# fifth is chi squared weighting
# 0 = normal (weighted by noise, see below)
# 1 = maximum likelihood (weighted by fit value)
#     no noise is computed, so next parameter is irrelevant
0

# sixth is noise estimator
# 0 = constant, set as 0.1*(global average power)
# 1 = smoothed, set as 0.1*(local average power)
# 2 = wavelet, uses WT to estimate noise using smallest scale fluctuations
2
