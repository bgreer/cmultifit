# Next are parameters for fit convergence

# Relative chi-square convergence criterium
1e-8

# Relative parameter convergence criterium
1e-4

# Orthogonality convergence criterium
1e-8

# Max number of iterations.
# If this number is hit before convergence, fit is deemed invalid
1500


# Next are filenames for debug output. Fair warning, they produce a lot of data

# Fit output. Set to 0 for no output
# After each successful multifit, outputs fit result
# Format (8 columns):
# theta	k	nu	data	fit	noise	background	residual
debug

# Covariance output. Set to 0 for no output
# After each successful multifit, outputs log10 of covariance matrix
# If set to 'file', output files will be 'file_##', where ## is the k-bin
# Format (3 columns):
# i	j	log10(abs(cov(i,j)))
covar

# To easily plot, use gnuplot:
# set pm3d map
# splot 'covar'

# Background output. Set to 0 for no output
# After each successful multifit, outputs final parameters of background terms
# Format (8 columns):
# k-bin	k	par0	par1	par2	par3	par4	par5

# Acoustic cutoff frequency (in uHz)

# Fit simple peaks above acoustic cutoff frequency
# 0 = no fits above
# 1 = simple fits (no velocities)
# 2 = full fits (ignore cutoff frequency)

# Auto-detect ridge number
# 0 = Every fit mode is n=0
# 1 = Auto-detect in log-log space
